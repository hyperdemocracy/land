title: Hyperdemocracy

Hyperdemocracy is a series of lessons, speeches, programs, and productions -
made by coders challenged by the many problems of public policy.

[Our opening session][round-1] on July 24, 2023 had around a dozen audience members.
Some came to learn new ML skills.
Some came for more exposure to processes of legislation and group decision-making.
All of us learned a bunch, and are eager to keep pushing the dialogue ahead.
