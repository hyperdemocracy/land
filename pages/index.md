title: Hyperdemocracy
---

*Hello, "demos!"*

Hyperdemocracy is a series of lessons, speeches, programs, and productions -
made by coders challenged by the many problems of public policy.

Our opening session on July 24, 2023 had around a dozen audience members.
Some came to learn new ML skills.
Some came for more exposure to processes of legislation and group decision-making.
All of us learned a bunch, and are eager to keep pushing the dialogue ahead.

You can help us build the curriculum; please use the `#hyperdemocracy` channel,
in the [HacDC Discord](https://discord.gg/YTeBg2fEgX).
All upcoming sessions are announced in our [remarks](/posts),
alongside any other ideas to come to mind.
