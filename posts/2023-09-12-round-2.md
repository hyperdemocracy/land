A day has been chosen for our second round of Hyperdemocracy;
please mark your calendars on Saturday, October 28.
Our group is going to be headed across the Potomac to Rosslyn, VA;
our colleagues in [Unstuck Labs](https://www.unstucklabs.com/) are sharing their amazing space
for the day.

You can help us build the curriculum; please use the `#hyperdemocracy` channel,
