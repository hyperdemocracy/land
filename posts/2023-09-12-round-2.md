A day has been chosen for our second round of Hyperdemocracy;
please mark your calendars on Saturday, October 28.
Our group is going to be headed across the Potomac to Rosslyn, VA
to commandeer the offices of [Unstuck Labs](https://www.unstucklabs.com/).
Please plan to spend the day.

Round one had been a basic lesson in language models,
using this year's congressional legislation as our collection
of open-source language. Our audience members,
each one skilled in coding already,
heard some quick speeches describing the mechanisms of LLMs,
and an expos√© of the public policy research landscape.

Our main aim had been to share [sample code in Python][ipynb]
([runnable in the cloud][colab]),
making use of [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/) to access OpenAI's models.
Our example builds up a Question & Answer program
based on legislation produced by the US Congress in 2023.

This round, our [organizers](/organizers) plan to bring in more speakers,
to discuss some of the ethical quandries that can be caused by relying too much on ML models.
This is going to also be a chance to look beyond federal legislation,
and to bring in more sources from regional or non-legislative legal sources.

You can help us build the curriculum; please use the `#hyperdemocracy` channel,
in the [HacDC Discord](https://discord.gg/YTeBg2fEgX).
